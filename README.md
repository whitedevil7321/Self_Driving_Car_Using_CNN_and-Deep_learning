# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Project Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques

I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a **Self-Driving Car** built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Deep Neural Network (DNN)** techniques! This project combines cutting-edge AI methods with real-world testing to simulate autonomous driving.

## 📚 Key Concepts Implemented

### ✔️ Behavioral Cloning
- Mimics human driving behavior by learning from recorded driving data.

### ✔️ Data Augmentation
- Applied techniques like flipping, brightness adjustment, and shadow effects to enhance training data diversity.

### ✔️ Model Creation, Building, and Training
- Designed and trained deep learning models optimized for real-time driving tasks.

### ✔️ Training CNNs with Image Data
- Processed camera feed images to predict steering angles, braking, and acceleration.

### ✔️ Road Sign Detection
- Integrated image classification techniques to recognize and react to road signs.

### ✔️ Braking, Acceleration, and Turns
- Developed control logic for safe navigation, including braking, acceleration, and making turns.

### ✔️ Polynomial Regression for Motion Planning
- Implemented polynomial regression to enable smooth motion planning and path prediction.
